# RISCademy  

RISCademy is an interactive learning platform designed to help students learn **RISC-V assembly** in a structured, engaging, and accessible way.  

This project was developed as a **first-year university group project** at the **University of Manchester**, inspired by the lack of comprehensive online resources for RISC-V assembly — a powerful yet niche instruction set architecture.

## 🎯 Why RISCademy?  

While RISC-V is becoming increasingly relevant in modern computing, learning resources remain limited compared to mainstream programming languages.  
RISCademy fills this gap by providing a **student-friendly, interactive, and gamified** platform that makes learning assembly concepts both practical and enjoyable.
